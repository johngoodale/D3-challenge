          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks, Income, and Age</h3>
          <p>As we can see above there is a correlation as household income decreases, the percentages increase for those who are obese and smoke. States that show higher household 
              income also showed lower clusters of the pecentage of citizens lacking heathcare. While more indepth analysis is needed, the visuals provide good insight of trending that
              is showing the less wealthy citizens are incurring more health risks with less healthcare coverage.</p>
          <br>
          <p>When we look at the same health data against median age by state, there is nothing that stands out in particular when trying to uncover large glaring trends. Since the median age by 
              state is going to be close across the US, we can expect to see a cluster of data which is shown. There is a heavy cluster of obese % around 27-30 with the median ages around 36-40.
              We do see a slight cluster increase in % of Smokers as median age increases, but again it is very slight. Of all the age reporting views, possibly the most identifiable trend is as median 
              age increases, the % of those who lack healthcare does decrease.  </p>
